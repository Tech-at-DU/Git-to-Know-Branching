Ready to merge to `origin/main`?

Let's make it happen using the following three step process!

# Step 1 - Move to Main Branch

> In your local repository directory, run the following command to switch to the `main` branch.
>
```bash
$ git checkout main
>
Switched to branch 'main'
```
>

# Step 2 - Pull the Latest Changes

> [action]
> Pull the latest changes from `origin/main`, integrating the changesets into your local repository.
>
```bash
$ git pull origin main
>
From github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/git-branchy
* branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
```
>

# Step 3 - Merge!

> [action]
> Let's merge by running the command below!
>
```bash
$ git merge develop
>
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
test.js              |  0
1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
create mode 100644 test.js
```
>

# Step 4 - Push to GitHub

>
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "[add] merge the develop branch"
$ git push origin main
```
